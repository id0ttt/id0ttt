I'm a university student @ Monash University studying Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Science
I've decided to expand my knowledge of this space outside the guidance of my University degree
Come along and see what I've got to offer!
Here is my University GitHub where you can see the work I've done for my Universtiy teams :)
